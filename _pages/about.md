Currently, I am using this website as a blog to record my study notes and random stuff I come across during the work. This is not a formal and nice looking personal website. Maybe later I will turn it to be a better looking personal site, but right now I write most of the thing for myself. If someone happends to enter this webpage, I am sorry for the comfusion. Hopefully what I wrote can give you some inspiration.
